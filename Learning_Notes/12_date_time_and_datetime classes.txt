We are going to take a look at the rich libarary of the predfined code that comes with python in order to the biuld functionality into python apps.
 and in this lesseon we are going to look at date and times.
In order to use the rich functionality of libraries which python provides we need to tell python where to go get it from.
To do that we need to use "import" statement
======
from datetime import date
from datetime import time
from datetime import datetime
==============

So we are going to tell the python interpreter that from "datetime" standard module that comes with stabdard library. I want to import the date, time, and datetime classes.

These are predefined pieces of functionality in the python libarary that let me manipulate dates and times. So, I don't have to write code. I can just just it by importng the modeule in the class.

to get the today's date we can use
today = date.today()

to get the separate components of date then
we can use 
today.day
today.month,
today.year

The date object also provides some useful properties that I can use in other more advanced features of an app.

I can retrieve the week day number and that starts off at zero for Monday and goes up to six on Sunday

program
=========
today = date.today()
 print ("today's date is ", today)

=========program indivial compnents of date
print("date components :" today.day, today.month,today.year)

weekday number
print("today weekday # is", today.weekday())

refer the python program it has all the notes
