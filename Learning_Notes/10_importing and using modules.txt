oen of ythe most powerful features of python is a large number of libarary modules with a pre-built code that you can use in your programs and the standard python installation contains quite a few of these modules. 

Lets take look a at the example of a code module that yo don't have to write yourself
open module_start.py

Lets import math modeule.
contains function to calculate math functions

use function sqrt()
when you type math. then the intellisense shows you all the functions and constants that are available in a math modeule.
in that cube symbol means a function and yellow two side arrow mean a constant.

Modeules can define functions, classes, contants




we other lesson we are going to look at some great modeules.
calculating dates and times and working with files and even processing internet  based data like HTML, XML and JSON
